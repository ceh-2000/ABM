The goal of any discipline, whether it be physics, linguistics, or agent-based modeling, is to model the world as close to reality as possible. In linguistics, researchers have observed rules that govern speech down to the sound level to better model how humans communicate using language. In physics, theorems describe phenomena like how the momentum in a system of two particles will be conserved even at the quantum level. With respect to agent-based modeling, data scientists seek to better model complex adaptive, economic and social systems. While the surface-level models that each discipline hopes to construct vary wildly, I would argue that data science and other disciplines interact as a positive feedback loop to create new knowledge. 

Transfer learning is the idea that one can take a machine learning model that’s been trained on one data set, and transfer its framework and weights to quickly and more accurately train a new model on a new data set. Likewise, ideas and models from other disciplines can be transferred to data science applications to improve models. 

The gravity model is based on the physicist’s formula for gravity: the force of gravity is directly proportional to the square of the masses and the inverse square of the distance. In order to predict one key process of human development which is movement, data scientists determined that this model could be tweaked to use the number of people moving as the masses and the distance they have to move in place of the distance between the masses. They went even further to allow additional variables to be included to improve the model like income, gender, etc. This matters because, for instance, a wealthier person may have a car and be able to travel farther to and from work. Much like transfer learning, the original model framework remains with some modifications to tailor it to the data set, in this case the movement of people. 

Fractals are a math concept for which structures are made of the same units of the whole. This recursive structure can also be applied to understand how people organize in communities. Smaller groups of people mirror their larger communities. Again, the math concept of fractals can be used as a model for social systems in data science.

With respect to biology, Owen Barder states, “And his (Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen) insight, which is, really, at the heart of all this stuff, is that economic systems are not like evolutionary systems, they are evolutionary systems.” Barder goes one step further than simply applying models from other disciplines, in this case biology’s process of evolution, to understand development with data science. He claims it is an evolutionary model. While in some cases like the example of the gravity model it makes sense to approximate human processes with a transferred model, sometimes the underlying model of human development simply is the observed process. 

A final example illustrating how theory from other disciplines can support data science is the discovery of the Higgs Boson. An ongoing argument in data science concerns the need for theory: if we have enough data, can’t we just put it in an unsupervised machine learning model and see what we find? While it’s tempting to just throw models at data, sometimes the theory does still matter. Physicists postulated the existence of the Higgs Boson as part of the standard model to explain the weak force interactions between subatomic particles. To find this particle, scientists sought to measure energy signatures with the Large Hadron Collider. However, collecting 30 petabytes of information per year made it infeasible to simply look at all the data. With an understanding of physics theory, scientists could sift through the noise and identify the energy signatures corresponding to Higgs bosons and show the existence of the particle. In this example, data science was not enough and the theory was still important. 

So far we’ve discussed how data science is impacted by other disciplines and the world. But I argued at the beginning that this is a closed positive feedback loop. The other half of the argument is that data science impacts the world, specifically agent-based modeling allows us to describe, analyze and predict human processes. 

We start with a quote from Sinan Aral, “Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.” While theorizing is possible, measuring experimentally improves the outcomes. Applying this idea to agent-based modeling, when we can predict how people move and view interactions of agents as evolving and adaptive, we can better model human behavior. Essentially, the world can learn from agent-based modeling. 

One place where we have seen a “revolution in measurement” would be deep learning. In recent years, deep learning has become faster and more accessible with user-friendly packages like Keras and Tensorflow. This makes it even easier to train models on diverse datasets and make predictions. For instance in this class, I used the household dataset for Eswatini including variables like gender of the individual, number of people in the household, and age to predict education using a very basic neural network. 

Another area of significant advancement and research regards addressing the zero cell problem. One key issue when creating models for human development is missing data. One option is to simply delete the observations with missing results i.e. if a person failed to disclose his or her age. However, advancements in data imputation allow researchers to impute missing data. A more sophisticated method of data imputation in the R package “missForest” imputes both qualitative and quantitative data points using random forests. Data imputation allows agent-based models to show a clearer picture of reality. 

Just as it can model the world, agent-based modeling has the potential to affect it. For instance, in this class, we examined how people move with a gravity model. An accurate understanding of how people migrate could affect policy decisions like building roads and expanding the necessary health infrastructure to support an influx of people. Just as the gravity model is influenced by outside disciplines like physics, the results of that model will affect disciplines like public policy and public health.

We have closed the loop and shown how other fields can affect data science which in turn affects other fields. While agent-based modeling has the potential to improve the human condition, this positive feedback loop could also reinforce existing biases. For instance, a gravity model trained on a high income country with efficient public transportation and high car use may not translate well when applied to a low middle income country with very different movement habits. While models allow us to visualize agents at the population scale, we must constantly ask questions like: is this really better than random? More importantly, it is important to recognize when our model failures could actually hurt the people we want to model. They could potentially contribute to pre-existing prejudices about a certain people’s way of life. In that case, random may have been more desirable. 

In the same sense that revolutions in measurement contribute to revolutions in science, advancements in data science are preceded by advancements and heightened understanding in other fields. Going one step further, the study of data science can likewise impact other fields, like with policy decisions made based on an agent-based model. It is important to recognize the power of more easily accessible modeling tools and of course the responsibility that comes with it.

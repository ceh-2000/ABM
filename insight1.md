# Insight I: Transfer Learning
### September 18, 2020

## Overview
Image classification is one of the essential purposes of deep learning. However, often this process can take a long time, so one method to improve models that perform image classification is through transfer learning.

Transfer learning allows data scientists to build better deep learning models faster because we use pretrained models to initialize our weights, instead of setting weights randomly. This usually leads to better models that can be trained more quickly.

## Purpose
Why care about image classification in human development? 

### Road Quality
One application is already being investigated on campus in the GeoLab regarding road quality. Thanks to the prevalence of satellite images, it is easier than ever to visualize roads in low middle income countries (LMIC). Pairing this data with vibration data from an Android phone app, we are able to train a model that can predict road quality. The satellite data is often open source, and most people have phones, so this is a relatively inexpensive method to assess road quality.

### Tracking Human Development in India
In LMICs, accurate settlement and household data is uncommon mostly because it is expensive and requires a concerted government effort. Thus, data scientists want to build models that can circumvent these issues and generate more accurate settlement data. In an article in the Medium, Adhya Dagar describes just this. In Dagar's example, researchers used a convolutional neural network and transfer learning in order to predict socioeconomic levels of different settlments (i.e. villages) by taking into account different indicators:
- Assets
- Bathroom facilities
- Condition of households
- Fuel for cooking
- Main source of light
- Main source of water
- Literacy

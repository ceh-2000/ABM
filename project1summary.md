# Project 1

For this first project I was looking at population, population density, accessibility, and topography in different subdivisions of Eswatini.

## [Part 1.a.](densitySwaziland.md)  
For the part a of the first part, I recolored a map of Eswatini's first level subdivisions based on population and noted the density of each subdivision on the plot. Later, I decided to focus on Hhohho, oe of Eswatini's subdivision. I chose it because it included the capital city and had varying populations and densities in each of its second level subdivisions, so I thought it would be interesting to investigate these differences further.
